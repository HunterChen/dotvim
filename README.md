## Vim configuration
===

This is my vim configuration. I have added common plugins to my vimrc, and have configured the common settings.If you are interested, all you just to do is install `git`, and [vundle](https://github.com/gmarik/Vundle.vim), then clone my repository to  your home directory. and rename `vimrc` file to `.vimrc`.Finally, put the `.vimrc` file to your home directory,namely `~/`.

More details, please refer to my vimrc file.
